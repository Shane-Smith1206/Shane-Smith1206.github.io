IG Landing Page is a web application that I put together for a client to help drive clients to their website. The project helped me learn how to design and implement a responsive web site.

In this project I gained experience with HTML, the [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) CSS Framework for the user interface, and Javascript.

Here is some example code to illustrate Simple Schema use:
